# 🐕 Winnie's Flamin' Health Insurance Empire 🐕

Welcome to the corporate jungle, kid. You're here because you've seen the vision: A world where **Health Insurance** is just as spicy, crunchy, and orange-dusted as a **Flamin' Hot Cheeto**. 

Our CEO, **Winnie** (the world's most business-minded Shiba Inu), has decided that traditional insurance is too "boring." She's rebuilding the industry from the paws up, and she needs *you* to do the heavy lifting (clicking).

## 🏗️ The Corporate Mechanics

### 🟠 The Giant Cheeto
The beating heart of our enterprise. Click it. Smush it. Every click generates **Revenue**, but be warned: it also generates **Spice** and **Audit Risk**. You cannot have the crunch without the heat.

### 📈 Tiers of Expansion
We have **40 Tiers** of increasingly questionable business units. Start small with a humble **Standard Claim Form** and work your way up to the **Winnie National Health Empire**. Each tier increases your **Revenue Per Second (RPS)**, allowing you to earn cash even while you're napping (or chasing your tail).

### 🌶️ The Spice Meter (Exposure)
Handling this much orange dust is dangerous. As you click, your **Spice Level** rises. 
- **The Melt**: If Spice hits the limit, we have a **Meltdown**. Everything turns into a blur, and Winnie might lose her cool for a few seconds.
- **Cooling Down**: Spice decays naturally over time, provided you stop touching the Cheeto for a second.

### 🚔 The Audit Risk (Liability)
The "government" and "regulatory boards" (buzzkills) are always watching.
- **The Audit**: If Risk hits 100%, you get slapped with a **Federal Audit**. Your revenue is halved until the heat dies down.
- **Paper Trail**: High-tier items generate passive risk. The bigger you are, the harder they try to count your beans.

### 📄 Compliance Credits (The Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free Card)
For every **500 manual smushes**, Winnie earns a **Compliance Credit**. 
- **FILE REPORT**: Use a credit to file a very official-looking document. This immediately vents **30 Spice** and **30 Risk**, making the auditors look the other way.

### ⬆️ Upgrades & Milestones
Unlock over **100+ Upgrades**! From "Cheeto Dust Fingers" (Double Click Power) to "Milk Chugs" (Higher Spice Tolerance). Keep an eye out for global milestones that permanently shift the reality of your corporate surroundings.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer
This is satirical. Winnie is a very good girl and has never actually committed insurance fraud. Please do not attempt to fund a health insurance empire with snacks in real life.

*Paws up, Revenue up!* 🐕💰🔥
