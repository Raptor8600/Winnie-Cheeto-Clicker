# 🐕 Winnie's Flamin' Health Insurance Empire 🐕

Welcome to the corporate jungle, kid. You're here because you've seen the vision: A world where **Health Insurance** is just as spicy, crunchy, and orange-dusted as a **Flamin' Hot Cheeto**. 

Our CEO, **Winnie** (the world's most business-minded Shiba Inu), has decided that traditional insurance is too "boring." She's rebuilding the industry from the paws up, and she needs *you* to do the heavy lifting (clicking).

## 🏗️ The Corporate Mechanics

### 🟠 The Giant Cheeto
The beating heart of our enterprise. Click it to generate **Revenue**.
- **Click Power**: Invest in upgrades like *Cheeto Dust Fingers* and *Diamond Claws* to multiply your manual income.
- **Scaling**: After Level 10, your clicks gain additional power equal to **1% of your RPS**.

### 🌶️ The Spice & Risk Systems
Handling this much orange dust is dangerous.
- **Spice Level**: Rapid clicking builds spice. If it caps, you hit a **Meltdown**—pure chaos for a few seconds.
- **Audit Risk**: questionable business practices raise risk. At 100%, a **Federal Audit** halves your revenue until resolved.
- **Compliance Credits**: Earn credits every 500 clicks. Use **FILE REPORT** to immediately vent 30 Spice and 30 Risk.
